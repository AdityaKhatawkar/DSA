Recursion can be used when a bigger problem is dependent on a smaller problem. 
example: if we wanna find 2^3, then it's dependent on finding 2^2 first. that is 2^3 = 2 * 2^2. 
so we can make the recursive ralation of 2^n = 2 * 2^n-1; 
or in a function as: 
    f(n) = 2 * f(n-1)


Base case is the smallest possible answer that we know.
It is mandatory to return in base case.
It will tell us when to stop. 
Will give segmentation fault if not used.
