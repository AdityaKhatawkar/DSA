The algorithm takes one value at a time from the unsorted part of the array and puts it into the right place in the sorted part
of the array, until the array is sorted.


ALGORITHM 
InsertionSort(A[0..n-1])
Sorts a given array using insertion sort
Input: An array A[0..n-1] of orderable elements
Output: Array A[0...n-1] sorted in ascending order
for i-> 1 to n - 1 do
    v -> A[i]
    j -> i - 1
    while j >= 0 and A[j] > v do
        A[j + 1] -> A[j]
        j -> j - 1
        A[j + 1] -> v

Why insertion sort? 
- Adaptable
- Stable 

Space Complexity : O(1)
Time Complexity : O(n^2)
Best case : O(n)
Worst case : O(n^2)
