Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
In every ith round, the ith largest element is set to its correct position.

ALGORITHM :

BubbleSort(A[0..n-1])
Sorts a given array using bubble sort
Input: An array A[0..n-1] of orderable elements
Output: Array A[0...n-1] sorted in ascending order
for i -> 0 to n - 2 do
    for j -> 0 to n - 2 - i do
        if A[j+1] < A[j]
            swap A[j] and A[j+1]

Space Complexity : O(1)
Time Complexity : O(n^2)
Best Case : O(n^2)
Worst Case : O(n^2)

The code can be optimized by exiting the algorithm when no swaps are made in an iteration.

Stability : 
Bubble Sort is a stable sorting algorithm. We swap elements only when A is less than B. If A is equal to B, 
we do not swap them, hence relative order between equal elements will be maintained.
